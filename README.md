# Stats220

This is my _repo_ for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Psychology and Statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because i want to increase my confidence surrounding coding and computer science
- I am interested in learning about how to use coding to analyse and predict data.
